**TODO**

_Placeholder: following a trinitycore tutorial would work as well._

_To sum it up roughly, you need to compile AzerothCore with this setting -DTOOLS=1 in your cMake configuration and it will create the extractors, then you put the extractors in your client folder (C:\Programs\WorldOfWarcraft for example) and you run them. They will extract the files from your WOW folder._
_Once done you have the data required (maps, vmaps, mmaps, dbc) and you need to place them into your server folder._
